- hy2py commandlinetool (documented)
- butlast function added, calls islice -> always call list with butlast (not documented)

differences python - hy
- map calls imap instead of map -> probably conflict
- rest calls islice
- assert can't be called with string to specify error
- str not working in emacs but in terminal, workaround: call .__str__ instead
